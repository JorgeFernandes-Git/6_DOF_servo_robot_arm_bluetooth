# 6_DOF_servo_robot_arm_bluetooth

This is a robotic arm with 6 degrees of freedom, that is controlled by an android app via Bluetooth.

The robot arm uses 6 servo motors, 3 of them are MG995 (waist, shoulder, elbow) and the other 3 are SG90 (wrist roll and pitch, gripper). 
It uses an Arduino NANO, a pca9685 for connecting the servos, and an HC-05 for Bluetooth communication.
It's powered by a 5V - 3A power supply.
